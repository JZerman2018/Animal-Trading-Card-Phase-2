                <p id="summary">Grey reef sharks are grey in color and live near coral reefs. They feed on bony fishes,  cephalopods, and crustaceans.  They can reach about 6.6 feet in length, and can live up to 25 years in the wild. They are threatened by commercial fishing since they frequently get tangled in fishing nets. Scientists believe they may become endangered in the near future.</p>
